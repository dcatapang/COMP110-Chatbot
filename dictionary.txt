algorithm
a step by step list of instructions that will solve a problem if executed
Here is an example of an algorithm that computes the area of a square: (1) ask for the length, (2) square the length of the side, (3) display the area
Here is another example of an algorithm that computes the area of a triangle: (1) ask for the width and height, (2) multiply the width and height then divide by 2, (3) display the area
integer
a whole number value
Here is an example of an integer: 42
Here is another example of an integer: -72
double
a decimal number value
Here is an example of a double: 5.67
Here is another example of a double: 73.0
string
a sequence of characters that is enclosed by quotation marks.
Here is an example of a string: "Hello, World!"
Here is another example of a string: "apple"
data type
a classification of an object in Python, which defines what values it can take and what operations can be performed on it.
Here is an example of a data type: Integer (1, 2, -72, etc.)
Here is another example of a data type: String ("Hello, World!", "apple", etc.)
operator
a special token that represents computations like addition, multiplication, and division.
Here is an example of an operator: Addition (+)
Here is another example of an operator: Subtraction (-)
modulus operator
an operator that works on integers and yields the remainder of the first integer divided by the second integer. It is represented by %.
Here is an example: 7 % 2 = 1
Here is another example: 10 % 4 = 2
variable
a name that refers to a value
Here is an example of a variable: x
Here is another example of a variable: len
